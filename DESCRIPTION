Description: A variety of methods are provided to estimate and visualize
    distributional differences in terms of effect sizes. Particular emphasis
    is upon evaluating differences between two or more distributions across
    the entire scale, rather than at a single point (e.g., differences in
    means). For example, Probability-Probability (PP) plots display the
    difference between two or more distributions, matched by their empirical
    CDFs (see Ho and Reardon, 2012; doi: 10.3102/1076998611411918), allowing
    for examination of where on the scale distributional differences are
    largest or smallest. The area under the PP curve (AUC) is an effect-size
    metric, corresponding to the probability that a randomly selected
    observation from the distribution on the x-axis will have a higher value
    than a randomly selected observation from the distribution from the
    y-axis. Binned effect size plots are also available, in which the
    distributions are split into bins (set by the user) and separate effect
    sizes (Cohen's *d*) are produced for each bin - again providing an
    evaluation of the consistency (or lack thereof) of the difference between
    two or more distributions across different points on the scale. Evaluation
    of empirical CDFs is also provided, with  built-in arguments for providing
    annotations to help evaluate distributional differences at specific points
    (e.g., semi-transparent shading). All function take a consistent argument
    structure. The following effect sizes are estimable: (a) Cohen's *d*, (b)
    Hedges' *g*, (c) percentage above a cut, (d) transformed (normalized)
    percentage above a cut, (e) the area under the curve, and (f) the *V*
    statistic (see Ho, 2009; doi: 10.3102/1076998609332755), which essentially
    transforms the area under the curve to standard deviation units. By
    default, effect sizes are calculated for all possible pairwise
    comparisons, but a reference groups (distribution) can be specified.
